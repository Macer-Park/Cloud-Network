data-test="kcArticle-description"><p>I want to achieve equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP) with multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN tunnels that are associated with a transit gateway.</p></div><div class="custom-md-style" data-test="kcArticle-body"><h2>Resolution</h2>
<h3>Create a transit gateway, and then attach your Amazon VPC and a Site-to-Site VPN</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a transit gateway.<br/>
<strong>Important</strong>: When you create your transit gateway, you must turn on <strong>VPN ECMP support</strong>.</li>
<li>Attach your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs) to your transit gateway.</li>
<li>Create a Site-to-Site VPN, and then attach it to your transit gateway.<br/>
<strong>Important</strong>: AWS provides two routing options to create Site-to-Site VPN connections, static and dynamic. The dynamic option uses border gateway protocol (BGP). When you create your Site-to-Site VPN, you must choose <strong>Dynamic</strong> for <strong>Routing options</strong>. Static routing doesn&#x27;t support ECMP.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Confirm your customer gateway BGP configuration</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure to turn on asymmetric routing on your customer gateway. Check that the customer gateway is configured to perform ECMP for traffic going out to AWS for all Site-to-Site VPN tunnels. To do this, configure equal local preference value or weight on all the Site-to-Site VPN tunnels. If necessary, configure your customer gateway BGP to accept the route from AWS. This means that the customer gateway installs all routes with the same metric.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the customer gateway isn&#x27;t configured to perform ECMP, and asymmetric routing isn&#x27;t turned on, then packet loss can occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm that your customer gateway is advertising the on-premises prefix to AWS with the same BGP AS PATH attribute. For AWS to choose all of the available ECMP paths, the <strong>AS Path</strong> and neighbor <strong>AS Number</strong> must match.</p>
<p>For example, you want to use ECMP with two Site-to-Site VPN connections. The AS Number of your customer gateway is <strong>65270</strong>. In this scenario, configure your Site-to-Site VPNs like the following example:</p>
<p><strong>Site-to-Site VPN-A</strong><br/>
<!-- -->Tunnel 1 – AS PATH: 65270 (when advertising the prefix)<br/>
<!-- -->Tunnel 2 – AS PATH: 65270 (when advertising the prefix)<br/>
<strong>Site-to-Site VPN-B</strong><br/>
<!-- -->Tunnel 1 – AS PATH: 65270 (when advertising the prefix)<br/>
<!-- -->Tunnel 2 – AS PATH: 65270 (when advertising the prefix)</p>
<p>With the preceding configurations, AWS sends traffic with ECMP turned on for all four Site-to-Site VPN tunnels.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You must turn on <strong>Dynamic VPN</strong> and <strong>VPN ECMP Support</strong> on the transit gateway for ECMP to function properly. Modify the transit gateway to turn <strong>VPN ECMP Support</strong> on or off.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create a transit gateway route table, and associate your Amazon VPCs and Site-to-Site VPN to it</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Amazon VPC console console.aws.amazon" target="_blank">Amazon VPC console</a>.</li>
<li>From the navigation pane, choose <strong>Transit Gateways</strong>.</li>
<li>Review the <strong>Default association route table</strong> setting for your transit gateway. If it&#x27;s set to <strong>False</strong>, then proceed to step 4. If it&#x27;s set to <strong>True</strong>, then all the associations are already part of the default route table, so you can proceed to step 6.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Transit Gateway Route Tables</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Create Transit Gateway Route Table</strong>, and then complete the following:<br/>
<!-- -->For <strong>Name tag</strong>, enter <strong>Route Table A</strong>.<br/>
<!-- -->For <strong>Transit Gateway ID</strong>, choose the Transit Gateway ID for your transit gateway.<br/>
<!-- -->Choose <strong>Create Transit Gateway Route Table</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Route Table A</strong> (or the default route table of your transit gateway).</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Associations</strong>, and then choose <strong>Create Association</strong>.</li>
<li>For <strong>Choose attachment to associate</strong>, choose the association IDs for your Amazon VPCs and Site-to-Site VPNs. Then, choose <strong>Create Association</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat step 8 until all of your Amazon VPCs and Site-to-Site VPNs display under <strong>Association</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Propagate routes from your Amazon VPCs and Site-to-Site VPNs on the transit gateway route table</h3>
<ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Route Table A Propagation</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Propagation</strong>.</li>
<li>For <strong>Choose attachment to propagate</strong>, choose the propagation for the Site-to-Site VPNs and Amazon VPCs.</li>

Create a transit gateway.  \n    **Important**: When you create your transit gateway, you must turn on **VPN ECMP support**.\n2.  Attach your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs) to your transit gateway.\n3.  Create a Site-to-Site VPN, and then attach it to your transit gateway.  \n    **Important**: AWS provides two routing options to create Site-to-Site VPN connections, static and dynamic. The dynamic option uses border gateway protocol (BGP). When you create your Site-to-Site VPN, you must choose **Dynamic** for **Routing options**. Static routing doesn't support ECMP.\n\n### Confirm your customer gateway BGP configuration\n\n1.  Make sure to turn on asymmetric routing on your customer gateway. Check that the customer gateway is configured to perform ECMP for traffic going out to AWS for all Site-to-Site VPN tunnels. To do this, configure equal local preference value or weight on all the Site-to-Site VPN tunnels. If necessary, configure your customer gateway BGP to accept the route from AWS. This means that the customer gateway installs all routes with the same metric.\n    \n    **Note:** If the customer gateway isn't configured to perform ECMP, and asymmetric routing isn't turned on, then packet loss can occur.\n    \n2.  Confirm that your customer gateway is advertising the on-premises prefix to AWS with the same BGP AS PATH attribute. For AWS to choose all of the available ECMP paths, the **AS Path** and neighbor **AS Number** must match.\n    \n    For example, you want to use ECMP with two Site-to-Site VPN connections. The AS Number of your customer gateway is **65270**. In this scenario, configure your Site-to-Site VPNs like the following example:\n    \n    **Site-to-Site VPN-A**  \n    Tunnel 1 – AS PATH: 65270 (when advertising the prefix)  \n    Tunnel 2 – AS PATH: 65270 (when advertising the prefix)  \n    **Site-to-Site VPN-B**  \n    Tunnel 1 – AS PATH: 65270 (when advertising the prefix)  \n    Tunnel 2 – AS PATH: 65270 (when advertising the prefix)\n    \n    With the preceding configurations, AWS sends traffic with ECMP turned on for all four Site-to-Site VPN tunnels.\n    \n    **Note**: You must turn on **Dynamic VPN** and **VPN ECMP Support** on the transit gateway for ECMP to function properly. Modify the transit gateway to turn **VPN ECMP Support** on or off.\n    \n\n### Create a transit gateway route table, and associate your Amazon VPCs and Site-to-Site VPN to it\n\n1.  Open the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).\n2.  From the navigation pane, choose **Transit Gateways**.\n3.  Review the **Default association route table** setting for your transit gateway. If it's set to **False**, then proceed to step 4. If it's set to **True**, then all the associations are already part of the default route table, so you can proceed to step 6.\n4.  Choose **Transit Gateway Route Tables**.\n5.  Choose **Create Transit Gateway Route Table**, and then complete the following:  \n    For **Name tag**, enter **Route Table A**.  \n    For **Transit Gateway ID**, choose the Transit Gateway ID for your transit gateway.  \n    Choose **Create Transit Gateway Route Table**.\n6.  Choose **Route Table A** (or the default route table of your transit gateway).\n7.  Choose **Associations**, and then choose **Create Association**.\n8.  For **Choose attachment to associate**, choose the association IDs for your Amazon VPCs and Site-to-Site VPNs. Then, choose **Create Association**.\n9.  Repeat step 8 until all of your Amazon VPCs and Site-to-Site VPNs display under **Association**.\n\n### Propagate routes from your Amazon VPCs and Site-to-Site VPNs on the transit gateway route table\n\n1.  Choose **Route Table A Propagation**.\n2.  Choose **Propagation**.\n3.  For **Choose attachment to propagate**, choose the propagation for the Site-to-Site VPNs and Amazon VPCs.","totalFollowers":0,"votes":1,"upVotes":1,"downVotes":0,"comments":[],"status":"APPROVED","tags":[{"id":"TA7_uy9TgXQSSEU449Dxfobg","name":"AWS Virtual Private Network
